# Lost-Found
Its a vehicle theft detection system in which our ML model all over the city scanning all the vehicle numbers.
If a person lodges a complaint in our system with his vehicle number that number will be added to our lost vehicle list.
Ml model which will be scanning for all the numbers checks wheather the scanned number is in the lost vehicles list.
If it founds a vehicle moment in any part of the city, it sends its location and time to the registered user.

#Technology stacks we are planning to use are :- ML (transfer learning), React JS, MERN Stack Development.
